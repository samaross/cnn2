## STEP 1: Implement and test convolution
#  In this step, you will implement the convolution and test it on
#  on a small part of the data set to ensure that you have implemented
#  this step correctly.

## STEP 1a: Implement convolution
#  Implement convolution in the function cnnConvolve in cnnConvolve.m

## Use only the first 8 images for testing
conv_images = images[:, :, 0:8]

# NOTE: Implement cnnConvolve in cnnConvolve.m first!
convolved_features = cnn.cnn_convolve(filter_dim,num_filters,conv_images,W,b)

## STEP 1b: Checking your convolution
#  To ensure that you have convolved the features correctly, we have
#  provided some code to compare the results of your convolution with
#  activations from the sparse autoencoder
# (SR-71) wtf is this business about the sparse autoencoder?  holdover from earlier iteration?

#  To ensure that you have implemented pooling, we will use your pooling
#  function to pool over a test matrix and check the results.
